How to install a UI script in After Effects
1) Download the .jsx or .jsxbin script file.

2) Copy the file into the After Effects Scripts UI Panels folder:

- Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects <version>\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\

- macOS: /Applications/Adobe After Effects <version>/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/

3) Launch or restart After Effects.

4) Go to Window in the top menu and select your script (e.g., FENNEC Grid Script) to open it as a dockable panel.

5) (Optional) Enable scripts to run without warning:
Edit > Preferences > Scripting & Expressions and check Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network.
